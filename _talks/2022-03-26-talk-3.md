This seminar was presented as a part of the IDC452 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. The talk introduced the concept of path integrals in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, starting with the Schr√∂dinger propagator, and converting the operators inside the matrix product into an expression with purely classical variables. The final result is the propagator amplitude being expressed as a sum of $e^{iS[q(t)]}$ over all paths $q(t)$ in the system, hence motivating the name Path Integral. Path Integrals thus describe the same quantum mechanics in an alternate way without dealing with operators, and is an equivalent way of quantizing systems.
