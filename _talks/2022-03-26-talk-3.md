This seminar was presented as a part of the IDC452 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. The slides for the  seminar can be found [here](https://github.com/kunal1729verma/kunal1729verma.github.io/files/path_integrals_in_qm.pdf).

The talk introduced the concept of path integrals in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, starting with the Schr√∂dinger propagator, and converting the operators inside the matrix product into an expression with purely classical variables. The final result is the propagator amplitude being expressed as a sum of $e^{iS[x(t)]}$ over all paths $x(t)$ in the system, hence motivating the name Path Integral.

$$K(x_f, t_f ; x_i, t_i) = \langle x_f | \hat{U}(t_f, t_i) | x_i \rangle = \underbrace{\lim_{N \to \infty} \Big(\frac{m}{2 \pi i \epsilon}\Big)^{N/2} \int \prod_{n=1}^{N-1} d x_n}_{\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)]} \: e^{iS[x(t)]} = \int \mathcal{D}[x(t)] \: e^{iS[x(t)]}$$

Path Integrals thus generalize the action principle of classical mechanics, and is equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.
