This seminar was presented as a part of the IDC452 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. The slides for the  seminar can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation).
The talk introduced the concept of path integrals in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, starting with the Schr√∂dinger propagator, and converting the operators inside the matrix product into an expression with purely classical variables. The final result is the propagator amplitude being expressed as a sum of $e^{iS[x(t)]}$ over all paths $x(t)$ in the system, hence motivating the name Path Integral.

$$K(x_f, t_f ; x_i, t_i) = \langle x_f | \hat{U}(t_f, t_i) | x_i \rangle = \underbrace{\lim_{\substack{{N \to \infty}\\ {\epsilon \to 0}}} \qty(\frac{m}{2 \pi i \epsilon})^{N/2} \int \prod_{n=1}^{N-1} \dd x_n}_{\int \kern-0.5mm \mathcal{D}[x(t)]}\: e^{iS[x(t)]} = \int \mathcal{D}[x(t)] \: e^{iS[x(t)]}$$

Path Integrals are therefore an alternate formalism of quantization of systems.
