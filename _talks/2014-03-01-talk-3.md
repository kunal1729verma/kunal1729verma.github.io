This seminar was presented as a part of the IDC451 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. The talk introduced the "sign problem" in lattice QCD (i.e. Monte Carlo mehods can't be used), and a recently proposed solution to circumvent it - the Lefschetz Thimble method. This work was done as a part of a research project under Dr. Anosh Joseph, IISER Mohali. The recording of the seminar can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBm3V33SLJY), and the slides can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBm3V33SLJY).

The talk introduced the formalism of Lefschetz Thimbles for $0+0$-dimensional models, which serve as a good test-bed for playing with new ideas. The Lefschetz Thimble method was first proposed by Witten. It involves complexifying the fields themselves, which introduces new manifolds. Using Cauchy's integral theorem, we can then change the line integral into one over which the imaginary part of action is constant, and therefore the integral is (mostly) real. This is summarized in the following equation 
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} = \sum_m \langle \mathcal{K}_m, \mathbb{R} \rangle \int_{\mathcal{J}_m}$$
