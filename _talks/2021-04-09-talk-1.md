This presentation was given as a part of the term paper presentation for the course PHY306 Advanced Quantum Mechanics course at IISER Mohali. The slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.74.1157).


When one tries to solve the problem of the "hydrogen atom" using the Dirac equation, taking into consideration the correct relativistic effects, one finds that the energy eigenvalues are independent of the orbital quantum number $l$. This implied that the ${}^2 2s_{1/2}$ and ${}^2 2p_{1/2}$ states are degenerate. After a few years, with better equipment, experimentalists were able to find an unexplained transition of $\sim 1057 \text{ MHz}$ in the spectrum which even Dirac's theory couldn't predict. This is popularly known in literature as the Lamb Shift. Hans Bethe was the first person to derive the origin of this energy shift by taking into consideration electron's coupling with the vacuum electromagnetic field (an extremely nice discussion on the same is present [here](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/010/10/0033-0048)). A semi-classical and a much more intuitive (but heuristic) treatment of EM field coupling was presented later by Theodore A. Welton in his paper [Some Observable Effects of the Quantum-Mechanical Fluctuations of the Electromagnetic Field](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.74.1157), which analyses fluctations in the orbit of the electron due to field coupling, and derives the shift in energy using first-order perturbtation theory.
