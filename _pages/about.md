Hi! I'm Kunal Verma, a final year BS-MS student pursuing a major in Physics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) (IISER-M), India. My research interests lie broadly in the area of theoretical and computational **condensed matter physics**. I'm currently using both analytical and numerical methods to study topological lattice gauge theories and quantum spin models.

The purpose of this website is to act as an organized repository of the things I've done throughout my degree while also acting as a platform for those who wish to know more about me.

Current Research

For my MS thesis, I'm working with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/dept/physics/Sanjeev_Kumar.html) and [Prof. Vijay B. Shenoy](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~shenoy/). My current work broadly involves the study of quantum spin models and lattice gauge theories via Quantum Monte Carlo methods.
