On this page, I aim to compile any resources I come across that I feel might be useful for me and others. I will (hopefully) keep updating this list regularly.

## IISER Mohali coursework related
-----
* A [compilation of my notes](https://github.com/kunal1729verma/lecture_notes_physics_iiserm) for various courses that I credited at IISER Mohali.
* A few PHY101 Help Session tutoring scribbles -  [[27-02-2022]](https://kunal1729verma.github.io/files/hs_scribbles/27-02-2022_HS_notes.pdf), [[06-03-2022]](https://kunal1729verma.github.io/files/hs_scribbles/06-03-2022_HS_notes.pdf), [[03-04-2022]](https://kunal1729verma.github.io/files/hs_scribbles/03-04-2022_HS_notes.pdf) 

## Condensed Matter related
-----
* [Journal Club for Condensed Matter Physics](https://www.condmatjclub.org/) - a monthly selection of interesting papers by distinguished correspondents.
* [Computational Studies of Quantum Spin Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3281) by Anders Sandvik - a comprehensive article starting with Monte Carlo on classical spin systems, their finite size scaling analysis, all the way to exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo in quantum spin systems.
* [Computational Many-Body Physics course](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/trebst/Lectures/2021-CompManyBody.shtml) by Prof. Simon Trebst - an excellent overview of modern numerical approaches to many-body systems.
* [An introduction to spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://scipost.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysLectNotes.11) by Aron, Louk and Jasper - set of notes on symmetries, spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions.
* [A pedagogical overview of the Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01258) by Dr. M.F.A. Resende - an introductory discussion on the topological order in the Toric Code and the correspoding quasiparticle excitations. 
* [Where do QFTs come from?](https://mcgreevy.physics.ucsd.edu/s14/239a-lectures.pdf) - a set of lecture notes by Prof. McGreevy with a focus on understanding how QFT arises from condensed matter systems.
* [Why Gauge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5599) by Carlo Rovelli.

## General links
-----
* [Andrew Lucas' Old Problem collection](https://www.alucasphys.com/problems.html) - an interesting set of problems by Andrew Lucas ranging from undergraduate mechanics to String Theory.
* Another great [Useful Links](https://ciaranhickey.weebly.com/useful-links.html) page by Dr. Ciar√°n Hickey.
