## Education
-----
* **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali** <br> BS-MS Dual Degree, Physics Major (2018 - 2023)
  * Cumulative GPA: **9.52/10** (till Semester 8)  
* **Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi** <br> CBSE Board, Secondary and Senior Secondary School (2015 - 2018)
  * AISSCE, Class 12: 95.4% score
  * AISCE,  Class 10: 10.0/10 CGPA

## Research Experience
-----
* **Masters thesis project with [Prof. Vijay B. Shenoy](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~shenoy/), IISc Bengaluru** (January 2022 - Present) <br> _Project Assistant, IISc_
  * Currently working on studies to explore phases of lattice gauge theories using quantum Monte Carlo methods.
  * Preliminary work involved studying the classical Ising model in 2D and extracting critical exponents via finite-size scaling analysis.
  * Working with _C++_, _Python_. 

---

* **Research internship with [Dr. Anosh Joseph](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/Faculty/anoshjoseph/), IISER Mohali** (April 2021 - August 2021) <br> _Research Intern_ 
  * Complex Langevin and the Lefschetz Thimble methods as primary candidates to deal with the "sign problem" (which makes application of standard Monte Carlo methods problematic) in Lattice QCD.
    * _Complex Lagevin_: Based on stochastic quantization of the fields. The field configuration is evolved according to a SDE and its equilibrium configuration is chosen as the sampling configuration. 
    * _Lefschetz Thimbles_: new manifolds, equivalent to the original domain of integration, are found in the complexified space, along which the imaginary part of the action is constant and, therefore, the integral is (mostly) real.
  * Worked with _Python_, _Mathematica_.
