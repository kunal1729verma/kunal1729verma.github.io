## Education
-----
* **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali** <br> BS-MS Dual Degree, Physics Major (2018 - 2023)
  * Cumulative GPA: **9.52/10** (till Semester 8)  
* **Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi** <br> CBSE Board, Secondary and Senior Secondary School (2015 - 2018)
  * AISSCE, Class 12: 95.4% score
  * AISCE,  Class 10: 10.0/10 CGPA

## Research Experience
-----
* **Semi-classical Monte Carlo simulations of $J_1 − J_2$ model** with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/dept/physics/Sanjeev_Kumar.html) (January 2023 - Present) <br> _Master's Thesis, IISER Mohali_
  * The goal of the project is to study if the singlet-dimers of the $J_1 − J_2$ model are the source of quantum fluctuations.
  * Currently working on implementation of a Metropolis MCMC algorithm which includes formation
and breaking of “semi-classical” singlet-dimers.

* **Exploring topological order in $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory** with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/dept/physics/Sanjeev_Kumar.html) and [Prof. Vijay B. Shenoy](http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~shenoy/) (January 2022 - Present) <br> _Master's Thesis, IISER Mohali and IISc Bengaluru_
  * Studying topological order in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory by mapping it to a dual model, which turns out to be the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) with the singlet constraint.
  * Ising model with the singlet constraint can be simulated via a discrete-time Path Integral (quantum) Monte Carlo scheme while ensuring subsystem symmetries are preserved.
  * Monte Carlo averages of physical operators can be used to study the critical properties of the model using finite-size scaling.

* **Numerical methods to evade sign problem in lattice QCD** with [Dr. Anosh Joseph](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/Faculty/anoshjoseph/), IISER Mohali (April 2021 - August 2021) <br> _Summer Project, IISER Mohali_ 
  * Complex Langevin and the Lefschetz Thimble methods as primary candidates to deal with the "sign problem" (which makes application of standard Monte Carlo methods problematic) in Lattice QCD.
    * _Complex Lagevin_: Based on stochastic quantization of the fields. The field configuration is evolved according to a SDE and its equilibrium configuration is chosen as the sampling configuration. 
    * _Lefschetz Thimbles_: new manifolds, equivalent to the original domain of integration, are found in the complexified space, along which the imaginary part of the action is constant and, therefore, the integral is (mostly) real.
  * Worked with _Python_, _Mathematica_.

* **Gamma-ray spectroscopy to study decay processes** with Prof. Rudrajyoti Palit, TIFR Mumbai (December 2019)  <br> _NIUS 16.2 Project, TIFR Mumbai_ 
  * Introduction to methods of radiation emission and detection, interaction of radiation with matter and detector working principles. Detection of gamma rays using scintillation detectors and PMTs.
  * Wrote a code for detection of peaks in a $\gamma$-ray spectrum generated.
  * Discontinued due to COVID-19 pandemic.

  * Introduction to basics of _Quantum Computing_ and physically realizing it using NMR. 
  * Designed an algorithm for experimentally evaluating expectation values of operators.
  * Performed Quantum State Tomography of mixed states to extract the approximate density matrix using IBM-Q Experience.
